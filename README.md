Vagrant-LAMP
============
These scripts and the accompanying Vagrantfile can be used to set up either a plain vanilla LAMP stack or one with a Laravel project.

It's still a work in progress but it works for the most part. 

#Instructions
Open up your preferred command line interface (CLI) in the folder in which you want to keep your Vagrantfile.

Run "./setup.sh" and respond to the prompts. 

That's it.
